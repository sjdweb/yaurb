# Yet Another Universal React Boilerplate

This is basically [React Universally](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally/) with:
 - Redux
 - Sass
 - React Router Redux
 - Axios middleware for your actions
 - A little bit of auth boilerplate
 - Some cleaner opinionated ways of writing reducers and actions

This may not be maintained and is purely for myself.
